            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon softened butter, divided</li>
                <li>5 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, tail removed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li>
                <li>2 slices sandwich bread</li>
                <li>1 slice Colby Jack cheese</li>
                <li>1 slice sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon butter. Add shrimp. Sprinkle shrimp with garlic granules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook until shrimp are pink, opaque, and slightly curled into a loose “C” shape, 1 to 2 minutes per side, depending on size. Remove
                    shrimp to a cutting board and chop roughly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread a thin layer of softened butter on 1 side of each bread slice. Place bread buttered side down in the same skillet. Place a slice
                    of Colby Jack cheese on bread, top with shrimp pieces. Place Cheddar cheese slice on top of shrimp. Place remaining bread slice on top
                    of sandwich, buttered side up. Cook until bread is golden on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully turn sandwich over with a spatula. Cook the other side until golden and cheese is fully melted, 2 to 3 minutes. If cheese is
                    not melted by the time sandwich is golden, cover the skillet for 30 to 60 seconds.
